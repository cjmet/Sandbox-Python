# Latest Breakthroughs in Quantum Computing

## Introduction

Quantum computing harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics to process information in ways that classical computers cannot, holding promise for unprecedented computational power. In recent years, the field has seen rapid advances as researchers overcome key technical hurdles and achieve major **milestones**. Leading tech companies like Google and IBM now believe a full-scale, practical quantum computer is within reach by the end of this decade ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/2fe4b1a3-b0d3-403a-bdd3-f033b3e5e56a#:~:text=As%20of%20mid,today%E2%80%99s%20systems%20with%20under%20200)). Spurred by scientific breakthroughs, these firms – along with others such as Microsoft, Amazon, and startups (e.g. IonQ and D-Wave) – are racing to scale up prototype quantum systems into functional, large-scale machines ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/ibm-aims-quantum-computer-2029-lays-out-road-map-larger-systems-2025-06-10/#:~:text=initiatives%2C%20emphasized%20that%20the%20challenge,the%20potential%20of%20quantum%20computing)).

## Achieving Quantum Advantage

One hallmark achievement has been reaching **quantum computational advantage** (also known as “quantum supremacy”), where a quantum device performs a calculation infeasible for any classical computer ([postquantum.com](https://postquantum.com/industry-news/google-sycamore-quantum-supremacy-2019/#:~:text=Quantum%20Supremacy%20%E2%80%93%20a%20term,Google%E2%80%99s)). In the past few years, multiple milestones have demonstrated this extraordinary capability:

- **2019 (Google)** – Google’s 53-qubit _Sycamore_ processor performed a specific random-circuit computation in about 200 seconds – a task estimated to require at least **10,000 years** on the world’s fastest supercomputer ([postquantum.com](https://postquantum.com/industry-news/google-sycamore-quantum-supremacy-2019/#:~:text=supremacy,take%20%E2%80%9Cthe%20largest%20and%20most)). This experiment, published in _Nature_, marked the first-ever claim of quantum supremacy, showing a programmable quantum machine decisively outperforming classical computing on a benchmark problem ([postquantum.com](https://postquantum.com/industry-news/google-sycamore-quantum-supremacy-2019/#:~:text=supremacy,take%20%E2%80%9Cthe%20largest%20and%20most)).

- **2020 (USTC, China)** – A team at the University of Science and Technology of China built a photonic quantum computer named _Jiuzhang_ that completed a boson-sampling problem in roughly 200 seconds. By comparison, a classical supercomputer would need an **astronomical 2.5 billion years** for the same task ([postquantum.com](https://postquantum.com/industry-news/china-jiuzhang-quantum/#:~:text=experiments%20reported%20on%20December%203%2C,qubit%20Sycamore)). This was the world’s **first optical quantum computer** to achieve quantum advantage, and only the second overall demonstration after Google’s 2019 result ([postquantum.com](https://postquantum.com/industry-news/china-jiuzhang-quantum/#:~:text=astonishing%20speedup%20%E2%80%93%20about%2010,to%20reach%20this%20benchmark%E2%80%8B%2C%20using)). Jiuzhang’s feat – using photons (particles of light) instead of electronic qubits – underscored a fundamentally different approach to reaching quantum advantage ([postquantum.com](https://postquantum.com/industry-news/china-jiuzhang-quantum/#:~:text=only%20the%20second%20time%20ever,instead%20of%20electronic%20circuits)).

- **2022 (Xanadu)** – Canadian startup Xanadu reported that its _Borealis_ photonic quantum processor completed a complex Gaussian boson-sampling calculation in mere **microseconds**, whereas the best classical algorithms would take an estimated **9,000 years** to produce similar output ([www.theregister.com](https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/02/quantum_advantage_canada/#:~:text=Researchers%20in%20Canada%20have%20conducted,a%20conventional%20computer%209%2C000%20years)). This experiment provided another independent confirmation of quantum advantage, using a different platform (programmable light-based circuits) to vastly outperform classical computation on a specialized problem ([www.theregister.com](https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/02/quantum_advantage_canada/#:~:text=Researchers%20in%20Canada%20have%20conducted,a%20conventional%20computer%209%2C000%20years)).

- **2023 (D-Wave)** – D-Wave Systems, a pioneer in quantum annealing, announced that its latest quantum annealer solved a materials science optimization in about **20 minutes**, a problem that would have required nearly **one million years** on a conventional supercomputer ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/984205be-ab3a-4bd1-8a8d-9b00bf8ad8b0#:~:text=D,faced%20financial%20difficulties%20and%20industry)). This result, published in _Science_, represents a form of quantum advantage for annealing-based quantum computers ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/984205be-ab3a-4bd1-8a8d-9b00bf8ad8b0#:~:text=D,faced%20financial%20difficulties%20and%20industry)). Unlike the gate-based quantum processors used by Google and others, D-Wave’s machine focuses on optimization tasks; achieving such a dramatic speedup in this domain was a significant validation of D-Wave’s 25-year pursuit of practical quantum computing ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/984205be-ab3a-4bd1-8a8d-9b00bf8ad8b0#:~:text=D,faced%20financial%20difficulties%20and%20industry)). (Notably, because annealers are not universal quantum computers, some experts term this a “quantum **advantage**” rather than full supremacy.)

## Scaling Up Qubit Hardware

Beyond one-off demonstrations, another critical measure of progress is the **scaling of quantum hardware** – increasing the number and quality of qubits in a system. IBM has been a leader in this area, steadily growing the qubit count on its superconducting quantum processors. In 2021 IBM unveiled the 127-qubit _Eagle_ chip, and by late 2022 it debuted _Osprey_ with **433 qubits**, tripling the prior record and significantly expanding the machine’s computational state space ([www.sciandnature.com](https://www.sciandnature.com/2022/12/ibm-announces-worlds-fastest-quantum.html#:~:text=IBM%20unveiled%20its%20most%20powerful,qubit%20Eagle%20processor)). At the IBM Quantum Summit in November 2023, IBM announced _“Condor,”_ a **1,121-qubit** processor – the first quantum chip to surpass one thousand qubits ([postquantum.com](https://postquantum.com/industry-news/ibm-condor/#:~:text=Yorktown%20Heights%2C%20N,the%20global%20race%20for%20quantum)). This heavy-hexagon architecture chip more than doubled IBM’s previous qubit count record and set a new high-water mark in the race for quantum computing power ([postquantum.com](https://postquantum.com/industry-news/ibm-condor/#:~:text=Yorktown%20Heights%2C%20N,the%20global%20race%20for%20quantum)). Remarkably, IBM managed to scale to this 1,121-qubit level **without degrading qubit fidelity**: the _Condor_ chip’s coherence times and gate fidelities are said to be on par with its 433-qubit predecessor, thanks to engineering innovations in 3D packaging and cryogenic wiring that maintained qubit quality at scale ([postquantum.com](https://postquantum.com/industry-news/ibm-condor/#:~:text=This%201%2C121,feat%20%E2%80%93%20scaling%20up%20qubit)). This ability to add many more qubits _while preserving performance_ is a crucial breakthrough for building larger quantum machines ([postquantum.com](https://postquantum.com/industry-news/ibm-condor/#:~:text=This%201%2C121,feat%20%E2%80%93%20scaling%20up%20qubit)).

IBM’s roadmap outlines a path to a practical quantum computer by 2029, aiming to integrate on the order of **200 logical qubits** (error-corrected qubits) in a system codenamed “Starling,” to be housed in a new quantum data center ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/ibm-aims-quantum-computer-2029-lays-out-road-map-larger-systems-2025-06-10/#:~:text=IBM%20announced%20its%20plan%20to,currently%20struggle%20with%20error%20rates)). To achieve this, IBM has adopted new error-correction strategies that prioritize hardware realism. Since 2019, the company has focused on designing error-correcting schemes around what current chips can support, rather than idealized theoretical codes – a shift that has **significantly reduced the number of physical qubits required** per logical qubit ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/ibm-aims-quantum-computer-2029-lays-out-road-map-larger-systems-2025-06-10/#:~:text=requiring%20many%20qubits%20to%20correct,Gambetta%2C%20IBM%E2%80%99s%20VP%20of%20quantum)). This pragmatic approach is expected to accelerate progress toward large-scale machines, complementing the pure increase in qubit count.

Superconducting qubits (used by IBM and Google) are not the only hardware showing progress. Trapped-ion quantum computers – developed by companies like **IonQ** and **Quantinuum** – have achieved some of the highest fidelities and a performance metric called _quantum volume_ that reflects both qubit quantity and quality ([www.quantinuum.com](https://www.quantinuum.com/blog/quantinuum-announces-quantum-volume-4096-achievement#:~:text=Quantinuum%20Announces%20Quantum%20Volume%204096,doubled%20its%20performance%20to%20become)). IonQ, for example, announced a 32-qubit ion-trap system in 2020 with “perfect” qubits, estimating a quantum volume exceeding **4,000,000** (over four million) for that device ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2020/10/01/ionq-quantum-computer#:~:text=The%20startup%20IonQ%20has%20announced,competitive%20week%20in%20the%20quantum)). While defined under specific assumptions, this claim highlighted the extremely high gate fidelities possible with ion-trap technology ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2020/10/01/ionq-quantum-computer#:~:text=The%20startup%20IonQ%20has%20announced,competitive%20week%20in%20the%20quantum)). IonQ also became the **first quantum hardware company to go public** in 2021 (via a SPAC merger), signaling growing investor confidence in the field ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2021/10/02/ionq-quantum-computing-trading#:~:text=IonQ%20has%20become%20the%20first,from%20producing%20widely%20reliable%20hardware)). It has since outlined plans to scale its trapped-ion systems (aiming for a 64-qubit device by 2023) and has acquired firms like Oxford Ionics to advance its qubit control methods ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2021/10/02/ionq-quantum-computing-trading#:~:text=stock%20decline%20by%20about%2010,Additionally%2C%20the%20XPRIZE)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/quantum-computing-firm-ionq-acquire-uk-based-oxford-ionics-108-billion-2025-06-09/#:~:text=known%20for%20its%20innovative%20control,broader%20industry%20moves%2C%20including%20Nvidia%E2%80%99s)).

Similarly, Honeywell’s quantum division (now **Quantinuum**) achieved record improvements in quantum volume on its ion processors, doubling from QV 2048 to **4096 by 2022** ([www.quantinuum.com](https://www.quantinuum.com/blog/quantinuum-announces-quantum-volume-4096-achievement#:~:text=Quantinuum%20Announces%20Quantum%20Volume%204096,doubled%20its%20performance%20to%20become)). These gains stem from incremental hardware and software upgrades that enhance qubit coherence and gate accuracy. Other hardware approaches are also maturing: **photonic** quantum computing startups (e.g. **PsiQuantum** and the aforementioned Xanadu) are pursuing light-based qubits that could be easier to scale via optical chip fabrication, and **neutral-atom** quantum computers (like those from **QuEra** and ColdQuanta) use arrays of ultracold atoms controlled by lasers to realize qubits with potentially great scalability. Each platform has recently tallied notable achievements – from Xanadu’s photonic processor attaining quantum advantage to QuEra’s demonstrations of quantum simulation and error-corrected operations – underscoring that no single technology dominates all progress. The industry’s diversity of approaches acts as a **portfolio of experiments** exploring the best path to a large, stable quantum computer.

## Advances in Quantum Error Correction

A core obstacle in quantum computing is **error correction**. Qubits are inherently noise-prone: they suffer random flips or loss of quantum state (decoherence), especially as more qubits are added. Quantum error correction (QEC) schemes solve this by encoding a single logical qubit into many physical qubits in a clever way, so that errors can be detected and fixed on the fly. A long-sought breakthrough has been to demonstrate that a QEC code actually improves reliability (meaning the logical error rate decreases as the code size increases). In early 2023, Google’s Quantum AI team achieved this milestone. They showed that using a larger grid of superconducting qubits in a **surface code** reduced the error rate of a logical qubit compared to a smaller-code benchmark ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2024/12/09/google-quantum-computer-errors#:~:text=journal%20Nature%2C%20involves%20reducing%20errors,world%20problems)). In other words, they had crossed the critical “threshold” where adding more qubits and error-correction overhead _netted fewer_ errors – the first experimental proof that quantum errors can be suppressed faster than they accumulate ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2024/12/09/google-quantum-computer-errors#:~:text=journal%20Nature%2C%20involves%20reducing%20errors,world%20problems)). This result, published in _Nature_, was hailed as a **major step toward scalable quantum computing**, providing a “robust proof” that quantum systems can be made more stable by design ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/f1d26918-67c5-4b11-b47b-4904606a002f#:~:text=Google%20has%20made%20a%20significant,enhance%20the%20quality%20of%20quantum)). It vindicated over 20 years of research in error correction by finally showing measurable improvement at scale ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2024/12/09/google-quantum-computer-errors#:~:text=journal%20Nature%2C%20involves%20reducing%20errors,world%20problems)). Google’s approach leveraged improved hardware and a **surface-code** lattice of qubits, and the team noted it as evidence of the viability of building much larger, fault-tolerant quantum machines in the future ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/f1d26918-67c5-4b11-b47b-4904606a002f#:~:text=Google%20has%20made%20a%20significant,enhance%20the%20quality%20of%20quantum)).

IBM is pursuing a complementary route in error correction. Rather than using the surface code (which demands a fairly large overhead of physical qubits per logical qubit), IBM has been investigating more qubit-efficient codes – notably **low-density parity-check (LDPC)** codes – that could encode logical qubits with fewer resources ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/2fe4b1a3-b0d3-403a-bdd3-f033b3e5e56a#:~:text=433,it%20presents%20new%20technical%20complexities)). This approach could potentially yield the same error suppression with significantly lower qubit counts, though it introduces new technical complexities in chip design and control ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/2fe4b1a3-b0d3-403a-bdd3-f033b3e5e56a#:~:text=433,it%20presents%20new%20technical%20complexities)). IBM’s emphasis on hardware-aware error correction (designing codes that fit the connectivity and limitations of real devices) has, since 2019, **dramatically lowered the projected qubit requirements** for future IBM systems ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/ibm-aims-quantum-computer-2029-lays-out-road-map-larger-systems-2025-06-10/#:~:text=requiring%20many%20qubits%20to%20correct,Gambetta%2C%20IBM%E2%80%99s%20VP%20of%20quantum)). The trade-off is that such novel QEC schemes must be proven in the lab – something IBM is actively working on as qubit counts rise. Both Google’s and IBM’s efforts highlight that not only qubit **quantity** but also qubit **quality and architecture** are central to recent breakthroughs: reducing error rates and efficiently correcting errors are as crucial as adding more qubits.

At the same time, researchers around the world are pushing incremental improvements that underpin better error correction. Notably, record-high fidelities have been achieved in single-qubit operations. In mid-2025, a team demonstrated a **record-low error rate** of just **0.000015%** per single-qubit gate – that is only about 1 error in 6.7 million operations ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/scientists-hit-quantum-computer-error-rate-of-0-000015-percent-a-world-record-achievement-that-could-lead-to-smaller-and-faster-machines#:~:text=Scientists%20have%20set%20a%20new,trapped%20ions%20instead%20of%20photons)). This nearly tenfold improvement over the prior record (held since 2014) was achieved using a trapped-ion system with extremely precise control of qubits (specifically using calcium-43 ions in a room-temperature trap) ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/scientists-hit-quantum-computer-error-rate-of-0-000015-percent-a-world-record-achievement-that-could-lead-to-smaller-and-faster-machines#:~:text=achieving%20an%20extraordinarily%20low%20error,and%20performing%20at%20room%20temperature)). Such ultra-high-fidelity operations drastically reduce the initial “noise” in quantum computations, meaning far fewer qubits would be needed to correct errors in larger algorithms ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/scientists-hit-quantum-computer-error-rate-of-0-000015-percent-a-world-record-achievement-that-could-lead-to-smaller-and-faster-machines#:~:text=breakthrough%20dramatically%20minimizes%20quantum%20computing,and%20performing%20at%20room%20temperature)). Indeed, the researchers used bespoke engineering (like automated microwave noise cancellation) to reach error rates that approach the theoretical limits, an advance that could eventually enable **smaller and more efficient** quantum hardware ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/scientists-hit-quantum-computer-error-rate-of-0-000015-percent-a-world-record-achievement-that-could-lead-to-smaller-and-faster-machines#:~:text=The%20researchers%20developed%20an%20automated,and%20practical%20quantum%20computing%20systems)).

Another breakthrough on the road to fault-tolerance was achieved in 2025 with a procedure known as **magic state distillation**. Magic states are special quantum states required to perform certain universal quantum logic operations (they’re an ingredient for executing non-Clifford gates in a fault-tolerant manner). For about two decades, scientists knew that _distilling_ high-fidelity magic states from noisy ones was necessary for a fully useful quantum computer, but it had never been demonstrated on actual quantum hardware. Using a **neutral-atom quantum computer** (QuEra’s _Gemini_ system), researchers successfully distilled five imperfect encoded “magic” states into one high-fidelity magic state, implementing this process on both distance-3 and distance-5 logical qubits ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/scientists-make-magic-state-breakthrough-after-20-years-without-it-quantum-computers-can-never-be-truly-useful#:~:text=Using%20the%20Gemini%20neutral,quantum%20computing%20closer%20to%20reality)). This experiment showed that the larger, more error-protected logical qubits (distance-5) produced better outcomes, validating a key component of the fault-tolerance toolkit in practice ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/scientists-make-magic-state-breakthrough-after-20-years-without-it-quantum-computers-can-never-be-truly-useful#:~:text=process%20on%20both%20Distance,quantum%20computing%20closer%20to%20reality)). It marks a pivotal step toward running error-resilient, universal quantum algorithms – effectively moving the field from just **proving feasibility** toward actually **delivering utility** ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/scientists-make-magic-state-breakthrough-after-20-years-without-it-quantum-computers-can-never-be-truly-useful#:~:text=success%20marks%20a%20pivotal%20step,quantum%20computing%20closer%20to%20reality)). Along with quantum error correction and ultra-high fidelities, such advances bring the vision of robust, general-purpose quantum computing closer to reality.

## Outlook and Key Players

Thanks to these breakthroughs, the quantum computing landscape has transitioned from pure theory to an **engineering race**. The consensus is that achieving useful, general-purpose quantum computers will require **scaling to millions of physical qubits** (to realize hundreds or thousands of logical, error-corrected qubits) ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/2fe4b1a3-b0d3-403a-bdd3-f033b3e5e56a#:~:text=milestone%3A%20building%20the%20first%20full,today%E2%80%99s%20systems%20with%20under%20200)) ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/f1d26918-67c5-4b11-b47b-4904606a002f#:~:text=chips,requiring%20approximately%20one%20million%20qubits)). Today’s state-of-the-art machines still have at most a few hundred qubits and can only solve specialized tasks, but the rapid progress in qubit count, coherence, and error mitigation is building confidence that a transformative quantum computer is on the horizon. Both Google and IBM have stated goals of developing large-scale, fault-tolerant systems by the **late 2020s or early 2030s**, and their recent milestones – from qubit “mega-chips” to demonstrable error correction – support that timeline ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/2fe4b1a3-b0d3-403a-bdd3-f033b3e5e56a#:~:text=As%20of%20mid,today%E2%80%99s%20systems%20with%20under%20200)). They, along with other major players (Microsoft, Amazon) and well-funded startups, are investing heavily to overcome the remaining hurdles in materials, cryogenics, and chip architecture needed for a practical quantum machine ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/ibm-aims-quantum-computer-2029-lays-out-road-map-larger-systems-2025-06-10/#:~:text=initiatives%2C%20emphasized%20that%20the%20challenge,the%20potential%20of%20quantum%20computing)). Governments are also pouring resources into quantum research, recognizing it as a strategic technology.

Despite the optimism, significant challenges remain before quantum computers can tackle everyday problems. Engineering scalable systems means dealing with _exponential_ complexity in wiring and control as qubits increase, and further breakthroughs will be needed in areas like modular quantum architectures, better qubit connectivity, and integration of error-corrected logical qubits into algorithms ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/2fe4b1a3-b0d3-403a-bdd3-f033b3e5e56a#:~:text=Other%20challenges%20include%20reducing%20component,agencies%2C%20including%20DARPA%2C%20are%20now)). However, the **trajectory of progress** is clear: each year has brought record-setting accomplishments that were previously thought to be decades away. If this pace continues, the coming decade could usher in quantum computers capable of outperforming classical supercomputers not just in contrived tasks, but on problems of practical importance – from breaking certain cryptographic codes to simulating complex molecules for drug discovery. For instance, industry leaders envision future quantum machines optimizing chemical reactions for better batteries, designing new materials, and accelerating AI by solving problems that are intractable today ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-says-it-has-cracked-quantum-computing-challenge-with-new-chip-2024-12-09/#:~:text=commercial%20applications%2C%20Google%20envisions%20future,signifies%20a%20crucial%20step%20towards)). In summary, quantum computing has advanced from a scientific curiosity to a nascent technological revolution, with key companies and research teams achieving breakthrough after breakthrough. **Each milestone – higher qubit counts, quantum advantage demonstrations, improved error rates, and effective error correction – builds on the last, inching the world closer to the era of truly useful quantum computers.** ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/2fe4b1a3-b0d3-403a-bdd3-f033b3e5e56a#:~:text=milestone%3A%20building%20the%20first%20full,today%E2%80%99s%20systems%20with%20under%20200)) ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/f1d26918-67c5-4b11-b47b-4904606a002f#:~:text=chips,requiring%20approximately%20one%20million%20qubits))
